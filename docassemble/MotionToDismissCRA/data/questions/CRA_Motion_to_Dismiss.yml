  Motion to Dismiss Application for Child Requiring Assistance (CRA)
subquestion: |
  This form asks the court to dismiss an Application for Child Requiring Assistance. For more information on the CRA process please [click here](https://www.mass.gov/child-requiring-assistance-cases).

id: Reason for Motion to Dismiss CRA
question: |
  Reason for Dismissal Request
subquestion: |
  Why should the court dismiss the application for assistance?  
    
    First, state why the CRA was filed.  
  Second, state how the issues have been resolved.  
    
    
  Some of the **common reasons to dismiss** are: the issue that brought the petition before the court has been resolved; a parent no longer wants the case to be in court; or, the family has not been provided services to their satisfaction.
